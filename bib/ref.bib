Paris Sér I Math. 323 (1996) 1129–1134); Cardaliaguet (P.-L. Lions lectures at College de France. Online at https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~cardaliaguet/MFG20130420.pdf); and Overbeck, Röckner, and Schmuland (Ann. Probab. 23 (1995) 1–36), respectively, by different means, for functions on the space M of finite measures over a Riemannian manifold M. For a reasonable class of functions f, the extrinsic derivative DEf coincides with the linear functional derivative DFf, the intrinsic derivative DIf equals to the L-derivative DLf, and DIf(η)(x)=DLf(η)(x)=lims↓01s∇f(η+sδ·)(x)=∇{DEf(η)}(x),(x,η)∈M×M,where ∇ is the gradient on M, δx is the Dirac measure at x, and DEf(η)(x):=lims↓0f(η+sδx)−f(η)s,x∈Mis the extrinsic derivative of f at η∈M. This gives a simple way to calculate the intrinsic or L-derivative, and is extended to functions of probability measures.},

abstract = {To characterize the regularity of distribution-path dependent SDEs in the initial distribution which varies as probability measure on the path space, we introduce the intrinsic and Lions derivatives for probability measures on Banach spaces, and prove the chain rule of the Lions derivative for the distribution of Banach-valued random variables. By using Malliavin calculus, we establish the Bismut type formula for the Lions derivatives of functional solutions to SDEs with distribution-path dependent drifts. When the noise term is also path dependent so that the Bismut formula is invalid, we establish the asymptotic Bismut formula. Both non-degenerate and degenerate noises are considered. The main results of this paper generalize and improve the corresponding ones derived recently in the literature for the classical SDEs with memory and McKean-Vlasov SDEs without memory.}
